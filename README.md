## Android Project Template for Kotlin



Project template to jumpstart your next Android project with integrating best practices and tools.

## Motivation

When starting a new project, we often perform repetitive tasks that consume a considerable amount of our time and affect our productivity. The use of
this template eliminates these redundant activities and enables us to adhere to a consistent project architecture.


## Best Practices
* [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) of Android app using Kotlin, Jetpack components and SOLID principles.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for networking layer.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for image loading.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) for logging.
* [Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) for code style.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for dependency injection.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) for asynchronous programming.
* [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) for user interface and experience.
